This is the desktop fan-version of the mobile game called "I Love Hue". You can download the original [here] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zutgames.ilovehue&hl=en). I do not own an original idea. This project is non-profit only.
**Attention**: this is the WIP version, and it's stil full of bugs. I'm slowly and lazily working on it.
